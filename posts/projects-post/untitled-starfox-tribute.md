# Untitled StarFox Tribute

## Overview

This is my current ongoing and long term project. The goal is to make a game that plays like Starfox 64. I am making the game in Unity and am doing every part of it myself. I started this project in december of 2024, however life got too busy with me being in clubs, doing school, and also doing an internship, so I had to take a break for a year. So far the overall game loop is created. All that is left for a demo is to create a boss monster, model two enemies, create a dialog system, record voice actors, add in a pause menu, and create a title screen.
### Game Loop Development
The game loop of Starfox 64 is an on rails shooter with enemies and obstacles flying at you. To create something like this in Unity, I used the spline tool to make a path through a level, then I locked the camera to that spline, made it move along at a given rate, and I locked the main character to the the camera and made it always stay in front of it. Next was adding in barrel rolls, boosting, and slowing down. I am not the best animator, so I decided to code in my barrel roll using the doTween plugin which lets me rotate the player model super fast and return to original position when done. Speed up and slow down were super simple as well since they are just speeding up or slowing down the camera movement speed on a button click. Lastly I needed shooting which was as simple as creating a bullet prefab on button click that moves in the direction the gun is aiming, when it goes to far away, hits an enemy, or hits a wall, then it would destroy itself.
### 
The longest part of this project so far has not been the programming, but the 3D models and creating the levels. I found that coding in enemies, the gameplay loop, and any dynamic music to be fairly fast, but when it came to creating a massive forrest with fog, big abandoned buildings, and a sewer system to be extremely time consuming.
