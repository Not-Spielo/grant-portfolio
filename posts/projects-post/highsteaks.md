## Overview

This project was for a game jam done only in the University of Dayton Game Design Club, with the theme of gambling. For this game, I got together with 4 other friends and we decided to make a game where your goal is to make $10,000 in 5 days or the mafia will give you a visit. For each day you would have a stamina that went down for each game you played, and when it hit zero you would go to bed to get more stamina for the next day. Since every game needs you to spend money, what happens when you run out? Well you click on items in your room to sell them so you can continue gambling. 
### 
I acted as the Game Director, and as such I divied out task to everyone. I won't go in too much detail here, but you can see every single task and how it was delegated on this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1domoe1pzJ1tG_qgYhR0Lnh10XDhqZ2ixfTmDX_3ds78/edit?usp=sharing). To give a very short summary, I created the overall structure and feel of the game, then I divied out minigames to the other two programming members, one person was in charge of creating Blackjack and Poker, and another person was in charge of creating Plinko and Coin flip. I then described and did very very rough sketches for the art we would need and I sent it to my friend who is great at pixel art for him to draw. 
### 
The music for this game was also part of my job, I had one day left when I finally got to the music, so I kept it super simple. I made a 30 second song that seemlessly loops, then for each game I changed the instruments in my DAW. For example this would mean that the Poker song was the same as the plinko song, but the poker song was played on guitar while the plinko song was played with bells and synths. I then added some code in so that the music dynamically changes, and boom the music was complete.
### Conclusion
I learned a lot on this project since it was the first project where I was the sole Director and had to oversee everything. I kept up with everyones progress, created a document where everything in the game was written down from initial brainstorming to task for the final project, and I also was able to keep everyone on the same vision for the game. I do not think we made the best game ever, however I do think that we created the best game we could within in the time frame of 2 weeks. We had a consistent vision across the entire game, players understood how to play the game without oversight, bugs were minimal, and the game was feature complete with ending cutscenes.
