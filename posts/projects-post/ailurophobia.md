## Overview

During a two-week long horror-themed game jam, we decided to make a Visual Novel. The concept was, "You spot a book lying on the ground during a trip to your favorite library, but when you approach it- you're transported into a nightmare! Trapped in a room with a transforming feline monster, how are you meant to escape!?" I took more of a backseat role on this project as I was currently doing a Internship and had no free time. However, I was able to write the complete story, learn how to code in C, add the story into my friends custom engine, create a cool sound track, and act as a Co-Director who managed all the art, music, and overall game direction. 
### 
My biggest challenge on this project was that I didn't know C at all. Instead, I had to spend most of my time researching how to do basic things that would take me 5 minutes with C#. Because of that, I lessened my programming amount for this project and aimed to complete just one feature, the dialog. I used functions all the other team members created and with a little bit of their help i was able to piece together a script that would take in JSON files with the actual dialog and scene information and it would pass it onto the game functions as created by the other users.
### 
My next task was to actually write the story and put it in the JSON format, this part was not too difficult, I spent a few hours writing a short story, got feedback on it from the other users, I revised it. This continued until the story was complete and liked by everyone. The only problem with the story is that I didn't account for multiple endings, so the player didn't get any choices in the overall plot, they really just read an interactive book. You can read the draft of the story [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ekn56_SZD6K0XX4JYVJtASaxrixMHudU/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118138012490799645838&rtpof=true&sd=true) if you want.
