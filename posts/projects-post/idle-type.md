## Overview
This is a game I made fully alone for the "Universal University February Game Jam" The game jam ran for a whole weekend, but unfortunately, I only had about 8 hours to work on it, so I made this little prototype on my own in that time.
###  
The game jams theme was machines, so I interpreted that as a machine that carries every key you type into a little book and then keeps track of how much you type each character. If i had more time I would implement some more ideas I had to add some gameification to it, but since I only have 8 hours I decided to go with the minimum viable product which is really just a tracker of all the keys you type in a more fun way.
### Challenges
The biggest struggle I had was tracking all key input while the game is not focused. I ended up having to create a separate C# project that listens to all input and then my Idle Type game has that project built and embedded into it. The C# project then gets ran on startup and it passes all the inputs it captures to the application.
