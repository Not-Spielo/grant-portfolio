## Notes On Creation

For this Track I really wanted to try making my own breakcore track, and for that I wanted to actually make my own break beat instead of doing what a lot of other breakcore artist do and just taking the popular ones from online. I looked up what makes a break beat and after a few youtube videos I was able to make a pretty good beat. The next task was to get a cool vocal chop and make the song around both of those. I went through my 500 gig folder of old school Sample CD's and I came across this dude saying infinite, some filters and EQ on it to make it sound older and then the additon of synths and boom the track was created.
