## Game Overview

In 48 hours I created a short videogame that lets you control a tank and try to survive endless waves of enemies. This was my first time ever truly getting into videogames and as such I followed a guide for it and then I made it my own. It was a great way to learn Unity and taught me how to manage my time and crunch when neccesary.
