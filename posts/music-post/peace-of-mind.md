## Notes On Creation

This is my first collaboration with Sleepy Slim and we decided to make a jazzy lo-fi song. I started by making a very basic song then sending it over to him to add a saxophone. However, when he sent me his completed version of the song, I felt like it just wasn't complete. So I spent countless hours re-mixing and changing a bunch of parts of the song. After a week of working on it constantly, I was able to get it to sound to my liking. The thing that fixed it for me was me taking the saxophone and putting filters on it so its sound would match up with the other instruments better.
