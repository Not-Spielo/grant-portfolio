## Notes On Creation

This is the biggest song I have created, it has over 100,000 listens on spotify alone and doesn't seem to be slowing down. It is a collaboration with WLHR, the song was made by him first sending over a melody of the cover song done on piano, I then added a bunch of effects and other instruments to complete the song, lastly WLHR did a final mix on the song to fit some of his other work.
