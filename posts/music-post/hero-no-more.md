## Notes On Creation

This is the first piece of music I have ever made and as such means a lot to me. It is not nearly as good as other songs I have created, but it was where I started. I was trying to do a grand story told across this 3 song EP, and while a story is here, looking back it feels like way too much talking and not enough music. If I were to give another shot at something like this I would actually try to sing on the tracks or I would make the story told through more sound effects and such.
