## Notes On Creation

I heard this song "it's easy" by Olivia O. and I just really loved it. So I took the song, downloaded it, used a bunch of effects, filters, and an AI to remove the guitar strumming and make it just acapella, then I got to work on my own song just using the original songs lyrics. I pitched them up to get that chipmunk voice, put some more effects on them to get that raw retro feel, then I started to craft the song around the vocals. The  synth that does the melody in a high pitch it actually a quater second of Olivia's voice modulated and looped to make a home made synth. I then played that sound on a digital piano to get it to pitch up and down as I wanted. 
##  
I tried to get Olivia O's permission to post the song, unfortunately she never responded to my email. SO I just posted the song anyway, if you are Olivia and you would like me to take it down, just ask.
