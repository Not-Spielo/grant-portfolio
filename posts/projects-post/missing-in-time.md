## Overview

Created during a one-month Game Jam with the Game Design Club. The game jam rules stated we had to make a game that has something to do with secrets, so we decided to make a puzzle game where you are trying to uncover the secret of what your grandpa did. The puzzles are all based around time travel, you are given a book that lets you jump between the past and present and as you solve the three levels you learn about your Grandpas dark Past.  
###  
My role on this project was to help direct a team to create the final level and to manage all the art and music. The final level was supposed to use everything we have learned so far from the previous levels, picking up and placing items, time traveling to view the surroundings, and interacting with objects. For this I first drew out the design for the level, it would be a house with three puzzles, all giving a number you can use to open a safe which would give you a key to open a locked door. 
### Puzzle Designs
The first puzzle involved you interacting with book cases and pulling specific books out, if you pulled out the right books a blue number would appear, to give hints and clues on what books you should grab, we had time traveling hinting to what books are important throughout all three levels along with giving you hints when you click on the wrong book. 
### 
The second puzzle had you grabbing painting of animals and then placing them behind statues of those animals. To hint at this, we had an empty room with nothing but statues and then lights pointed at walls where paintings clearly belonged. We then scattered the 3 paintings throughout the house so the player ran around and grabbed the cats and dogs and threw them at the wall where they belonged. When all three painters were placed, a statue moved out of the way revealing a red number.
### 
The third puzzle had you simply time traveling to see that in the present a book shelf was knocked over revealing a green number.
### 
Lastly you take these colorful numbers, go to the safe and you type in the numbers according to the colors shown on the safe.
### Challenges
The biggest struggle I had during this project was time and managing a team. I am used to just sitting down and grinding out my own work, but since I took a leadership role on this project I was forced to talk to everyone and make sure that not just me, but everyone else got their work done. Two weeks ended up not being nearly enough for everyone else, so I ended up having to take work from others and do it myself to get the project finished on time. Thanks to this project I feel like I have become a much better team lead and I also have become better at just designing parts of videogames.
