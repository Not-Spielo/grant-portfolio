## Notes On Creation

This is the very first videogame soundtrack I made and it was a lot of fun. We made this videogame in about 2 weeks so that is all the time I had to make these 8 songs, and also code them into the game as dynamic music. The game has you changing between past and present with the click of the button, so I thought it would be awesome to have a past and present version of each song for all 3 levels. These versions are the same melody and BPM; but the drums, instruments, and effects are completely different, giving them completely different vibes. The songs are all great on their own, however I highly suggest you at least try out the game so you can see exactly what I am talking about with it being dynamic.
