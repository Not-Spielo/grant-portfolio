## Notes On Creation

This is my first full album. For this release I tried to create Lo-fi versions of all my favorite mario songs across the series. I also wanted every song to be absolutely amazing and I didn't trust my skills at the time, so I reached out to a bunch of other small lofi artist getting 10 of the 13 songs to have other artist featured on. The songs were not as hard to make because it is as simple as looking up sheet music for the pre-existing song, transcribing that to FL Studio, then adding in drums + effects + other instruments.
