# Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is a portfolio website I created to showcase my projects and music. It's built with simple HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to customize.

## Features

* Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
* Auto-generated project and music galleries from markdown files
* Simple to add new projects or albums - just create a new markdown file
* No build process or complex dependencies needed

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Markdown for content

## How to Use

1. Add your projects to the `posts/projects-post/` folder as markdown files
2. Add frontmatter to each markdown file with metadata like title, image, and description
3. The website will automatically generate cards and detail pages

### Example Frontmatter

```
